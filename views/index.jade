              p.large.
                  And you wouldn’t, technically, be wrong. We do work with
                  brands to create stories, experiences, and products that
                  are designed to make consumers in a noisy world sit up and take notice.

              h4.top-line.gray.short But that would only be half of the story.
              p.large.
                  Because for us, branding isn’t just what you see from the outside.
                  It starts from what’s true on the inside. It’s everything your business
                  stands for&mdash;what you make, why you make it, and how.

            .col
              h4.top-line.gray.short See, we’re kind of like brand therapists.
              p.large.
                  We help our clients look honestly at themselves (the good and the bad),
                  discover what makes them great, and then share that with the world in
                  a truthful way. Consumers certainly appreciate that.

              It’s about you, a little. But it’s really about them. Ultimately,
              your customers will decide. Seeing how your renewed brand can
              manifest in the world often spurs deep change on the inside and
              deep devotion on the outside.

              Rudi’s been leading cross-disciplinary creative teams for basically
              as long as he can remember. His background is on the agency side.
              But he’s also spent a good bit of time on the client side. He formed
              Sequitur over ten years ago&mdash;and has seen it grow and thrive in ways
              no one could have guessed. He’s equal parts writer and designer,
              thinker and doer&mdash;and he’s totally OCD. Really, you should
              see his desk. Immaculate.

              Which comes in pretty handy in our line of work. She’s a lady McGyver
              with years of experience managing studios that run like clockwork.
              And whenever our research gets us into a sticky situation, she always
              (usually with spearmint chewing gum and Black Cat firecrackers) gets us out.
              She keeps us honest, on time, and on-task.

              He’d never say so, but Ed’s definitely the baldest person in the office.
              He’s a rocket scientist (literally) with hardcore strategic chops, and
              tons of experience in the social sphere. He’s a brilliant designer with
              the mind of an engineer&mdash;not something you see everyday. Sure, it
              may sound like hyperbole, but Ed is precisely the voice of reason that
              we (and our clients) tend to value beyond words.
